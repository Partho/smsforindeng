PocketSphinx SMS
=======================================================

The original PocketSphinx Android application has been tweaked in order to use it as an Indian-English based SMS sending application. Since it uses the Android port of the Pocketsphinx speech recognizer, it does not require an internet connection. The Indian English model is included in assets folder. This application simply needs to be imported as project and one is free to modify according to one's requirement. No need to do the NDK build and SWIG build for the PocketSphinxAndroidDemo folder.
